### Ahoy! 

I'm currently studying an MSc in Neuroscience, having previously graduated with a joint degree in Maths and Psychology.
Fascinated by how information is represented in the brain and artificial neural networks.

Keen on implementing reproducible and reliable data analysis to wider problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on grid cell representations of complex mazes, modelling predictions ahead of data collection.
